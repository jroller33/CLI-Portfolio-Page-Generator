# CLI Portfolio Generator

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is a command-line tool that generates an HTML portfolio page from user input.
<br/>It uses `inquirer` version 8.2.4 and `node.js`.
<br/>Navigate to the directory, run `npm i` in the terminal, then run either `node asyncPromises.js` <br/> or `node asyncCallbacks.js`.
#
'asyncPromises.js' and 'asyncCallbacks.js' do the same thing, but for asynchronous functionality 'asyncPromises.js' uses promises and 'asyncCallbacks.js' uses callback functions.
